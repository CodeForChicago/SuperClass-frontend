Gulpfile has been changed in following way:

Rather than cleaning the whole file, we are cleaning only specific parts

Made new instances named delJs, and delFont, to replace del, and for clarity.
 
They do the same thing that del does just for the distFont and distJs instead 

of dist. 

We pass the callback function in the build task. We pass it to build, then cleanJs,

then to cleanFont, then to the final function which remains unchanged.
